# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Hugo static site for documenting the Anki MCP Desktop project, hosted at `ankimcp.ai`. The actual MCP server code lives at https://github.com/ankimcp/anki-mcp-server.

**Important**: "Anki" is a registered trademark of Ankitects Pty Ltd. This is an independent community project NOT affiliated with Ankitects. Always include trademark disclaimers when adding content.

### Content Sections
Top-level sections under `content/`:
- `docs/` — Product documentation (installation, features, FAQ, known issues)
- `blog/` — Release announcements and articles
- `about/`, `privacy/`, `terms/` — Static pages (legal pages include SaaS cloud + Discourse community terms)

### No Test Suite
This is a pure content repo. There is no test runner, no linter config, no CI verification beyond a successful Hugo build. Verification = `hugo --minify` succeeding + manual browser check via `hugo server`.

## Technology Stack

- **Hugo** v0.163.0 extended (production) - Static site generator
- **Hextra theme** v0.12.1 - Installed as Hugo Module (NOT git submodule)
- **Go** - Required for Hugo Modules. CI uses 1.21; `go.mod` declares 1.24.4 (local dev)
- **GitHub Actions** - Builds the site and deploys it to **Cloudflare Workers Static Assets** via `cloudflare/wrangler-action` on push to `main` (`.github/workflows/hugo.yml`). A second workflow (`.github/workflows/status.yml`) deploys the `status/` page independently. The main workflow's `submodules: recursive` checkout option is vestigial — the theme is a Hugo Module, not a submodule — but it's harmless.
- **Umami Analytics** - Self-hosted at analytics.anatoly.dev
- **MailerLite** - Newsletter integration (Form ID: `ZGJ6BF`, account: `1854759`)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Local development
hugo server --buildDrafts     # Include draft content

# Content creation
hugo new content/docs/your-page.md        # New docs page
hugo new content/blog/your-post.md        # New blog post
```

## Architecture Notes

### Hextra Theme CSS Convention
The Hextra theme uses `hx:` prefixed Tailwind utility classes (e.g., `hx:mt-6`, `hx:dark:text-gray-100`). All custom layouts use this prefix. Custom CSS overrides live in `assets/css/custom.css` and use `!important` to override theme defaults.

### MailerLite Form ID Coupling
The form ID `ZGJ6BF` appears in **three places** that must stay in sync:
- `content/_index.md` — hero button `onclick="ml('show', 'ZGJ6BF', true)"`
- `layouts/partials/footer.html` — footer newsletter link
- `layouts/shortcodes/newsletter.html` — embedded form shortcode

The MailerLite universal script is loaded in `layouts/partials/custom/head-end.html`.

### Trademark Disclaimer
The Anki trademark text lives in `i18n/en.yaml` as the `copyright` key (used by the footer). It's NOT in any layout file directly.

### Custom Sitemap
`layouts/_default/sitemap.xml` overrides Hugo's default sitemap with:
- Per-section priority: homepage=1.0, docs sections=0.8, docs pages=0.7, blog=0.6, other=0.5
- Frontmatter overrides: `sitemap_priority`, `sitemap_changefreq`, `sitemap_exclude`

### Reference Directories (gitignored)
- `SEO/` — Keyword strategy, competitor analysis, schema markup docs (reference only)
- `.claude-draft/` — Planning docs, deployment guides, TODOs

## Critical Configuration

### ⚠️ JS Minification MUST Stay Disabled
- `minify.disableJS: true` in hugo.yaml is **REQUIRED**
- JS minification breaks MailerLite newsletter popup
- Never enable under any circumstances

### Banner System
- Uses key-based dismissal (`params.banner.key` in hugo.yaml)
- Stores dismissal state in localStorage
- **Always change key** when updating message (current key is `naming-update-2025`; use any unique slug, e.g. `release-v0.7.0` or `naming-update-2026`)
- This forces banner to reappear for users who dismissed previous version

### Custom Layouts
Key overrides in `/layouts/`:
- `partials/custom/head-end.html` — Canonical URLs, MailerLite script, Schema.org structured data (SoftwareApplication, WebSite, BlogPosting, Organization), preconnect hints
- `blog/single.html` — Custom blog layout with breadcrumb, author attribution, tags (E-E-A-T SEO)
- `partials/footer.html` — Adds Newsletter/Email/Community Forum/Status links (Status points to https://status.ankimcp.ai/); keeps Hextra's `displayPoweredBy`/copyright logic (driven by `params.footer` in hugo.yaml)
- `shortcodes/newsletter.html` — Inline newsletter embed
- `_default/sitemap.xml` — Custom sitemap with per-section priorities

## Release Process

When announcing new versions:
1. Create blog post: `content/blog/vX.Y.Z-feature-name-release.md`
2. Update banner in `hugo.yaml`:
   - Change `params.banner.key` to new version
   - Update message and links
3. **Update Schema.org** in `layouts/partials/custom/head-end.html`:
   - Update `softwareVersion` field
   - Update `releaseNotes` URL to new blog post

## Deployment

The site runs on **Cloudflare Workers Static Assets**, not GitHub Pages. Two independent Workers are deployed from this repo:

- **`ankimcp-ai`** (root `wrangler.jsonc`, assets from `./public`) — the main site, built by Hugo and deployed by `.github/workflows/hugo.yml` on every push to `main` (except changes under `status/`).
- **`ankimcp-status`** (`status/wrangler.jsonc`, assets from `status/`) — the hand-written status page, deployed by `.github/workflows/status.yml` only when `status/**` changes.

Both configs are live on their custom domains — `routes` points `ankimcp-ai` at `ankimcp.ai` and `ankimcp-status` at `status.ankimcp.ai` — and `workers_dev`/`preview_urls` are `false` in both, so neither Worker is reachable on its `*.workers.dev` URL. `www.ankimcp.ai` is handled separately by a zone Single Redirect rule (see the history below), not by a route.

### Updating the status page
Edit `status/index.html` (the "EDIT HERE" block near the top holds the current notice and its "Last updated" timestamp — templates for maintenance/incident notices are inline as HTML comments), commit, and push — the `status.yml` workflow deploys it automatically. The page is a manually-posted announcements page, not a live monitoring dashboard — there's no per-component status list. To deploy it locally instead: `npx wrangler deploy -c status/wrangler.jsonc`.

Before running `wrangler deploy` for the **main site** locally, run `rm -rf public` first — Hugo doesn't clean stale files by default, and a leftover file from an old build (e.g. a stray `_redirects` or `CNAME`) would otherwise get uploaded as a static asset.

### Cutover history (GitHub Pages → Cloudflare Workers) — completed

The migration below has been carried out; `ankimcp.ai`, `www.ankimcp.ai`, and `status.ankimcp.ai` are live on Cloudflare Workers. Steps 1–7 are kept as a record of how it was done. Step 8 (rollback) stays actionable if GitHub Pages ever needs to be restored.
1. Create a Cloudflare API token with **Account · Workers Scripts: Edit** (account-scoped — Workers Scripts is not a per-zone permission), plus, scoped to zone `ankimcp.ai`, **Zone · DNS: Edit** and **Zone · Workers Routes: Edit**. Add it as the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` repo secret, plus `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (the account ID from the Cloudflare dashboard).
2. Push to `main` and verify the site on its `*.workers.dev` URL.
3. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Workers & Pages → ankimcp-ai → Settings → Domains & Routes → Add → Custom Domain**, enter `ankimcp.ai`, and when prompted about the existing apex A/AAAA records choose **"Override existing DNS record."** This swaps the apex atomically (no manual record deletion, no NXDOMAIN window) and provisions the certificate. Do not delete the apex records by hand first.
   *Superseded (2026-10-08):* the "Do not delete the apex records by hand first" line above no longer holds. The dashboard no longer offers the override prompt, and wrangler fails with error 100117 ("already has externally managed DNS records"). A repeat cutover, or a re-cutover after a step 8 rollback, needs the apex records deleted first and the custom domain attached immediately after.
   For `www`: change the existing `www` CNAME into a **proxied** placeholder `A` record, `www → 192.0.2.0` (a reserved originless address per RFC 5737 — Cloudflare intercepts the request before it ever reaches it). Then create a zone **Single Redirect** rule: when hostname equals `www.ankimcp.ai`, dynamic redirect to `concat("https://ankimcp.ai", http.request.uri.path)`, preserve query string, status 301. (The docs' simpler wildcard form is equivalent: match `https://www.ankimcp.ai/*`, redirect to `https://ankimcp.ai/$1` (dynamic) — either works.) Custom Domains require an exact hostname match, so `www` can't just be a second route on the same Worker — see https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/#redirect-between-www-and-root-domain.
4. Uncomment the `routes` block in `wrangler.jsonc` (apex only — `www` is handled by the redirect rule, not a route), then push, so the config file matches what the dashboard already created. Verify `https://ankimcp.ai` loads and `https://www.ankimcp.ai` redirects to it.
5. Repeat for status: no DNS record needs to exist beforehand. Uncomment the `routes` block in `status/wrangler.jsonc`, then push.
6. Once both custom domains were verified working, `workers_dev: false` and `preview_urls: false` were set in both `wrangler.jsonc` and `status/wrangler.jsonc` and pushed — otherwise the sites would have stayed publicly reachable at their `*.workers.dev` URLs indefinitely. (Done — see current config.)
7. In the GitHub repo, go to **Settings → Pages** and unpublish the site.
8. Rollback, if needed:
   - Restore `static/CNAME` with contents `ankimcp.ai`, commit, and push to re-publish GitHub Pages.
   - In the Cloudflare dashboard, remove the `ankimcp-ai` Worker's Custom Domain (Workers & Pages → ankimcp-ai → Settings → Domains & Routes).
   - Re-add the apex DNS records, proxied: `A` records `185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153`, `185.199.111.153`, and `AAAA` records `2606:50c0:8000::153`, `2606:50c0:8001::153`, `2606:50c0:8002::153`, `2606:50c0:8003::153`.
   - Restore the `www` CNAME (or leave the redirect in place, if `www` should keep pointing at the apex) and remove the Single Redirect rule if no longer needed.

## Content Standards

### Frontmatter Requirements
Required:
- `title` - Page title
- `description` - Meta description (150-160 chars ideal)

Recommended:
- `keywords` - SEO keywords array
- `sitemap_priority` - 0.0-1.0 (Homepage: 1.0, Important docs: 0.8, Blog: 0.6)
- `weight` - Navigation order (lower = first)

Blog-specific:
- `author` - Defaults to "Anatoly"
- `author_link` - Defaults to https://anatoly.dev
- `date` - Publication date

### Writing Guidelines
- **Primary audience**: Non-technical end users
- Keep explanations simple and visual
- Link to GitHub for developer documentation
- Include Anki trademark disclaimer on homepage and footer

## Verification

Repo-specific checks that can't be caught by the build alone:
1. `hugo --minify` — catches template/module errors. Must pass.
2. MailerLite popup — click the footer "Newsletter" link or hero CTA; the `ZGJ6BF` form should open. If it silently fails, check that `minify.disableJS` is still `true` in `hugo.yaml` (see Critical Configuration).
3. Structured data — after changing `layouts/partials/custom/head-end.html`, paste a built page URL into [Google's Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results).
4. Banner dismissal — after bumping `params.banner.key`, clear localStorage (or use incognito) to confirm the banner reappears.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```bash
killall hugo               # Kill existing processes
hugo server -p 1314        # Or use different port
```

### Module Issues
```bash
hugo mod clean             # Clear cache
hugo mod tidy             # Clean dependencies
hugo mod get -u           # Re-fetch modules
```

### Theme Not Working
1. Verify Hugo extended: `hugo version`
2. Check module: `hugo mod graph`
3. Clear and rebuild: `hugo mod clean && hugo server`
