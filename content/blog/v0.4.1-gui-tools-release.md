We're thrilled to announce Anki MCP 0.4.1, which brings **11 new GUI tools** for interacting with Anki's interface and automatic update notifications. This release makes it easier than ever to manage your flashcards with AI assistance.

## What's New

### 🎨 11 New GUI Tools

You can now control Anki's graphical interface directly through AI commands. These tools are perfect for editing workflows where you want to see and interact with Anki's UI.

**Browser Tools** - Navigate and manage cards
- `guiBrowse` - Open Card Browser with search queries
- `guiSelectCard` - Jump to a specific card
- `guiSelectedNotes` - Get currently selected notes

**Dialog Tools** - Open Anki windows for manual review
- `guiAddCards` - Pre-fill the Add Cards dialog
- `guiEditNote` - Open note editor for quick edits
- `guiDeckOverview` - View deck statistics
- `guiDeckBrowser` - Access deck management

**Utility Tools** - Helper actions
- `guiCurrentCard` - Get info about the current review card
- `guiShowQuestion` / `guiShowAnswer` - Control card display
- `guiUndo` - Undo the last action

### 🔔 Update Notifications

Web Mode users now get notified when updates are available:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Update available 0.3.0 → 0.4.1       │
│  Run npm i -g ankimcp to update       │
└───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The check happens automatically when you start the server, and won't slow down startup (it's cached and runs in the background).

### 🛡️ Smarter Safety Controls

We've strengthened warnings to prevent unwanted actions:

- GUI tools require **explicit user approval** - the AI won't open dialogs without your permission
- Improved `create_deck` warnings to prevent auto-adding notes
- All GUI tools are restricted to editing/creation workflows only (not for review sessions)

## Why This Matters

Before this release, Anki MCP could create and modify notes programmatically, but you couldn't see what was happening in Anki's UI. Now you can:

- **Open the Card Browser** to search and review changes
- **Pre-fill Add Cards dialog** with AI-suggested content, then review before saving
- **Edit notes visually** instead of just updating fields programmatically
- **Control review sessions** by showing questions/answers through the GUI

This gives you the best of both worlds: AI assistance with visual confirmation.

## Use Cases

**Editing Workflow**
```
You: "Find all my Spanish verb cards and open them in the browser"
AI: *Opens Card Browser with query "deck:Spanish tag:verb"*
You can now review and edit them visually in Anki.
```

**Assisted Creation**
```
You: "Prepare an Add Cards dialog for 'Buenos días' / 'Good morning'"
AI: *Opens Add Cards dialog with fields pre-filled*
You review it, adjust if needed, then click Add.
```

**Deck Management**
```
You: "Show me the overview for my Spanish deck"
AI: *Opens Deck Overview with statistics*
You can see due cards, new cards, and learning progress.
```

## Technical Improvements

Behind the scenes, we've also:

- Upgraded to pino v10 for faster logging
- Moved all test files to `__tests__/` subdirectories for better organization
- Updated dependencies (@types/node v24, MCP inspector v0.17)
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all GUI tools (203 tests passing)
- Standardized on npm (removed pnpm for consistency with CI/CD)

## Important Notes

**GUI Tools Require Explicit Permission**

All GUI tools have strong warnings in their descriptions. The AI won't use them unless you explicitly ask:

✅ "Open the browser and search for Spanish cards"
❌ The AI won't automatically open the browser while creating cards

**For Editing, Not Review Sessions**

GUI tools are designed for note editing and creation workflows. They're not meant to replace the review workflow (`get_due_cards`, `present_card`, `rate_card`), which works perfectly for spaced repetition sessions.
