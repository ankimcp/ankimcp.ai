We're excited to announce Anki MCP 0.3.0, which brings a highly requested feature: **Web Mode**. Now you can use Anki MCP with any web-based AI assistant, not just Claude Desktop!

## What's New

### 🌐 Web Mode (HTTP Transport)

You can now connect web-based AI assistants like Claude.ai, ChatGPT, and others to your Anki collection. Just run a simple command, create a tunnel with ngrok, and you're good to go.

```bash
npx anki-mcp-http
```

That's it! The server starts, and your AI can connect through the internet.

### 🎯 Two Ways to Use Anki MCP

We've clarified the two installation modes:

**Desktop Mode** - For Claude Desktop users
- One-click installation with `.mcpb` file
- Works offline, no server needed
- Perfect for local use

**Web Mode** - For web-based AI assistants
- Run a local server with one command
- Connect any AI that supports custom tools
- Access Anki from anywhere

### 🛠️ Easy Command-Line Interface

The new CLI makes it simple to customize your setup:

```bash
# Use default settings
ankimcp

# Custom port
ankimcp --port 8080

# Connect to AnkiConnect on another machine
ankimcp --anki-connect http://192.168.1.100:8765
```

### 📦 Available on npm

Install globally for the shortest command:

```bash
npm install -g anki-mcp-http
ankimcp
```

Or use it without installation:

```bash
npx anki-mcp-http
```

## Why This Matters

Before this release, Anki MCP only worked with Claude Desktop. Now you can:

- Use it with Claude.ai in your browser
- Try it with ChatGPT (if/when they support custom connectors)
- Connect any AI assistant that supports MCP or custom tools
- Access your Anki collection from any device

## Technical Improvements

Behind the scenes, we've also:

- Implemented Streamable HTTP transport (SSE is deprecated)
- Simplified the architecture to a single `dist/` directory
- Added automatic version syncing between `package.json` and `manifest.json`
- Created separate entry points for STDIO and HTTP modes
- Added startup banner showing configuration
