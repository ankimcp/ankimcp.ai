We're excited to announce Anki MCP 0.6.0, which introduces **intelligent prompts** to guide AI assistants in creating more effective flashcards. This release brings [Dr. Piotr Wozniak's evidence-based learning principles](https://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/twenty-rules-of-formulating-knowledge) directly into your workflow.

## What's New

### 📚 Twenty Rules Prompt

A new `twenty_rules` prompt based on Dr. Piotr Wozniak's groundbreaking research on knowledge formulation from SuperMemo. This prompt teaches AI assistants how to create flashcards that actually work.

**What it does:**
- Guides the AI to break down complex information into atomic, memorable pieces
- Applies 20+ evidence-based principles for effective learning
- Helps avoid common pitfalls like overly complex cards or ambiguous questions
- Optimizes cards for long-term retention

**Example:**

Instead of creating this ineffective card:
```
Q: What is photosynthesis?
A: It's a process where plants use sunlight, water, and CO2 to produce glucose and oxygen through chloroplasts using chlorophyll.
```

The AI will create atomic, focused cards:
```
Card 1:
Q: What are the THREE main inputs of photosynthesis?
A: Sunlight, water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2)

Card 2:
Q: What are the TWO products of photosynthesis?
A: Glucose (sugar) and oxygen (O2)

Card 3:
Q: Where in plant cells does photosynthesis occur?
A: In the chloroplasts
```

### 🎯 How to Use Prompts

In Claude Desktop, prompts are easily accessible through the attachment menu. Here's how:

**Step 1: Click the attachment button (+)**

![Click the plus button](/images/adding-prompt/prompt1.png)

**Step 2: Open the "Add from Anki MCP Server" menu**

![Select Anki MCP Server](/images/adding-prompt/prompt2.png)

**Step 3: Choose your prompt**

Available prompts will be listed - select **"Twenty rules"** for evidence-based flashcard creation, or **"Anki review"** for guided study sessions.

![Choose Twenty rules prompt](/images/adding-prompt/prompt3.png)

**Step 4: The prompt content is attached**

You'll see the prompt document attached to your conversation. Now just tell Claude what you want to learn!

The AI will automatically apply Dr. Wozniak's twenty rules, ensuring your cards are:
- ✅ **Simple** - One idea per card
- ✅ **Clear** - Unambiguous questions
- ✅ **Memorable** - Using mnemonics and visual imagery
- ✅ **Optimized** - For spaced repetition algorithms

### 🧠 The Science Behind It

Dr. Piotr Wozniak (creator of SuperMemo, the algorithm behind Anki) has spent decades researching how memory works. His "Twenty Rules of Formulating Knowledge" represent the gold standard for flashcard creation.

Key principles include:
- **Minimum information principle** - Simplest possible question
- **Avoid sets** - Split lists into individual items
- **Avoid enumerations** - Use cloze deletions instead
- **Optimize wording** - Remove unnecessary complexity
- **Use mnemonic techniques** - Make memories stick

By embedding these principles into the AI's instructions, every flashcard becomes more effective automatically.

## Real-World Impact

**Before twenty_rules prompt:**
```
Q: Explain the water cycle
A: Water evaporates from oceans, forms clouds through condensation,
   falls as precipitation, runs into streams and rivers, and returns
   to the ocean. It's continuous and involves evaporation, transpiration,
   condensation, precipitation, and collection.
```

This violates multiple principles: too much information, enumeration without cues, complex concepts mixed together.

**After twenty_rules prompt:**
```
Card Set: The Water Cycle

Card 1:
Q: What is the first stage where water becomes vapor?
A: Evaporation

Card 2:
Q: What process turns water vapor into clouds?
A: Condensation

Card 3:
Q: What do we call water falling from clouds?
A: Precipitation

Card 4:
Q: Where does rainwater ultimately return to?
A: The ocean (via streams and rivers)
```

Much more effective for long-term retention!

## Technical Improvements

### 🏗️ New Prompt Architecture

We've introduced a modern, maintainable prompt system:

**Markdown-Based Content**
- Prompts stored as `.md` files for easy editing
- Structured with H1 sections (Description, Content)
- Version-controlled alongside code

**Runtime Loading**
- Prompts parsed at server startup using remark
- Module-level caching for performance
- Full TypeScript type safety

**Dynamic Registration**
- Prompts generated dynamically from server
- No static manifest entries (fixes Claude Desktop validation issues)
- Automatic discovery by MCP clients

### 🔧 Bug Fixes

**Claude Desktop Validation Fix**
- Resolved prompt validation errors in Claude Desktop
- Changed from static manifest prompts to `prompts_generated: true`
- Now works reliably across all MCP clients

**Jest Configuration**
- Fixed ESM package compatibility issues
- Added remark ecosystem to `transformIgnorePatterns`
- All 217 tests passing

## Available Prompts

Anki MCP now includes two prompts:

1. **`anki_review`** - Guides AI through interactive review sessions
2. **`twenty_rules`** - Applies evidence-based principles to card creation

More prompts coming based on your feedback!
