We're excited to announce Anki MCP 0.7.1, which brings **STDIO mode support** to the npm package. Now you can use Anki MCP with popular MCP desktop clients like Cursor IDE, Cline, and Zed Editor - not just Claude Desktop!

## What's New

### 🔌 STDIO Mode Flag

A new `--stdio` flag for the `ankimcp` CLI command enables STDIO transport mode, making the server compatible with any MCP client that supports STDIO communication.

**What this means for you:**
- Use Anki with **Cursor IDE** - AI-powered code editor
- Use Anki with **Cline** - VS Code extension for AI assistance
- Use Anki with **any other MCP client** that supports STDIO

### 🎯 Universal Configuration

The same simple configuration works across all MCP clients:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anki-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "anki-mcp-http", "--stdio"],
      "env": {
        "ANKI_CONNECT_URL": "http://localhost:8765"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Just add this to your MCP client's configuration and you're ready to go!

## Why This Matters

Previously, Anki MCP was distributed in two separate formats:

1. **MCPB bundle** - For Claude Desktop only (one-click install)
2. **NPM package** - HTTP mode only (for web-based AI assistants)

This meant users of other MCP clients like Cursor or Cline couldn't easily use Anki MCP - they had to manually point to source files or build from scratch.

**Now with v0.7.1**, the NPM package supports both modes:
- **HTTP mode** (default) - For web-based AI assistants
- **STDIO mode** (with `--stdio` flag) - For desktop MCP clients

One package, all use cases! 🎉

## Getting Started

### For Cursor IDE and Cline Users

Both clients use the same configuration format:

**Method 1: Using npx (recommended)**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anki-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "anki-mcp-http", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Method 2: Using global installation**

First install: `npm install -g anki-mcp-http`

Then configure:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anki-mcp": {
      "command": "anki-mcp-http",
      "args": ["--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration file locations:**
- **Cursor IDE**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (macOS/Linux) or `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json` (Windows)
- **Cline**: Edit via Cline settings UI in VS Code, or directly edit `cline_mcp_settings.json`

**Windows + Cline**: If you encounter `spawn npx ENOENT` errors, use `"command": "cmd"` with `"args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "anki-mcp-http", "--stdio"]`

## Use Cases

### Learning While Coding

With Cursor or Cline, you can:
- Create flashcards for programming concepts while writing code
- Review algorithm cards during coding sessions
- Build technical vocabulary decks as you learn new frameworks

**Example workflow:**
```
You: (In Cursor while learning React Hooks)
"Create flashcards for useState, useEffect, and useContext with examples"

AI: *Creates Anki cards with code snippets and explanations*
```

## Installation Options

You now have **three ways** to use Anki MCP:

### 1. MCPB Bundle (Claude Desktop)
→ [Download from Releases](https://github.com/anki-mcp/anki-mcp-desktop/releases)

One-click install, perfect for Claude Desktop users.

### 2. NPM Package with STDIO (Other MCP Clients)

**Using npx (no installation):**
```bash
npx anki-mcp-http --stdio
```

**Using global install:**
```bash
npm install -g anki-mcp-http
anki-mcp-http --stdio
```

For Cursor, Cline, and other STDIO-compatible MCP clients.

### 3. NPM Package with HTTP (Web-Based AI)

**Using npx (no installation):**
```bash
npx anki-mcp-http
```

**Using global install:**
```bash
npm install -g anki-mcp-http
anki-mcp-http
```

For ChatGPT, Claude.ai, and other web-based AI assistants (use with ngrok).

## Upgrade Now
